# Worlds Project

This project includes two items, an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that generates NFTs, and a React web app.

The React app uses Ethers.js so that the site can connect to the site with an Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask and then interact with the deployed smart contract on the Ethereum mainnet, in this case allowing visitors to browse and even claim an NFT for themselves. The contract was compiled by Hardhat and was deployed with Hardhat through Infura.
