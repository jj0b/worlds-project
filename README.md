# Worlds Project

This project includes an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity that generates NFTs, as well as a React web app that through Ethers.js can connect to that contract, allowing visitors to the site to connect their Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask, and then browse and even claim an NFT for themselves. The contract is compiled by and can be deployed with Hardhat.
